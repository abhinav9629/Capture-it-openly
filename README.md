# Capture-it-openly
This is a project made during 48 hours of Hackathon- Electrothon3.0 conducted by SPEC, NIT Hamirpur under the Human Removal Foreground(Organisational Problem Statement from Spyne.ai)
We have developed an effective solution to facilitate picture capturing so that people can freely capture and edit according to their own wishes by removing the unwanted part without reducing the quality image.
This has been achieved using Semantic Segmentation,Floodfill Function and GANS
